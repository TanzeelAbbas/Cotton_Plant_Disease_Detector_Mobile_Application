# Cotton_Plant_Disease_Detector_Mobile_Application
This is a mobile application for detecting cotton plant diseases using machine learning techniques. The app uses the device's camera to capture an image of the cotton plant, and then uses a CNN model to identify the disease.

# UN Sustainable Development Goals
The Cotton Plant Disease Detector app can contribute to several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including:

SDG 2: Zero Hunger - By detecting and identifying cotton plant diseases early on, the app can help prevent crop loss and increase food security.

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being - The app can improve the health and well-being of farmers by helping them identify and treat crop diseases, which can ultimately improve their livelihoods.

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure - The app uses machine learning and other innovative technologies to improve cotton crop management, which can lead to more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production - By enabling farmers to identify and treat cotton plant diseases more effectively, the app can promote sustainable consumption and production practices.

SDG 15: Life on Land - The app can help reduce the negative impact of cotton plant diseases on the environment, by promoting sustainable agriculture and reducing the need for harmful pesticides and other chemicals.

# Features
1) Identify diseases in cotton plants using machine learning
2) Real-time disease detection using the device's camera
3) Display information about the detected disease
4) Display information about the detected disease in multiple Langauges

# Getting Started
how to run a cotton plant disease detector application using TensorFlow Lite model in Android Studio with Java language. Here are the steps you can follow:

1) Clone or download the repository to your local machine using  https://github.com/TanzeelAbbas/Cotton_Plant_Disease_Detector_Mobile_Application.git 
2) Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project". Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the project and select the project's root folder. Wait for the project to build and sync
3) Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator

# Dependencies
The app uses the following libraries and frameworks:

1) TensorFlow Lite for machine learning
2) Java Language
