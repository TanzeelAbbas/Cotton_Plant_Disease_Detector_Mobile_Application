# Cotton_Plant_Disease_Detector_Mobile_Application
This is a mobile application for detecting cotton plant diseases using machine learning techniques. The app uses the device's camera to capture an image of the cotton plant, and then uses a CNN model to identify the disease.

# UN Sustainable Development Goals
The Cotton Plant Disease Detector app can contribute to several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including:

SDG 2: Zero Hunger - By detecting and identifying cotton plant diseases early on, the app can help prevent crop loss and increase food security.

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being - The app can improve the health and well-being of farmers by helping them identify and treat crop diseases, which can ultimately improve their livelihoods.

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure - The app uses machine learning and other innovative technologies to improve cotton crop management, which can lead to more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production - By enabling farmers to identify and treat cotton plant diseases more effectively, the app can promote sustainable consumption and production practices.

SDG 15: Life on Land - The app can help reduce the negative impact of cotton plant diseases on the environment, by promoting sustainable agriculture and reducing the need for harmful pesticides and other chemicals.
